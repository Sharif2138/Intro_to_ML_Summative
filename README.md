**Early Skin Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning**

This notebook demonstrates experiments comparing traditional machine learning models and deep learning convolutional neural networks  for early cancer detection using medical images. 

Cancer is difficult to detect in early stages because diagnosis requires expensive tests, hospital visits, and skilled doctors. Many people cannot access these services quickly. This project aligns with my mission to develop advanced biotechnology solutions for faster, cheaper, and more accessible early cancer diagnosis.

I conduct multiple experiments to compare performance of classical machine learning models like SVM and Random Forest, deep learning CNN models, and transfer learning models such as MobileNet. We also analyze the effect of hyperparameters, embeddings, and regularization techniques on model accuracy and generalization.
